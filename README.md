# arduino_DFT

This code is a simple implementation of Discrete Fourier Transform on Arduino board. For testing, arduino mega was used, but code should work on most of the other boards too. It can be also modified for use with "not on arduino" AVRs.
All lines including "GLCD.something.." are used for displaying data on LCD (KS108 64x128 greaphical display). This lines can be simply removed without effecting the code.
